/**
 * An interface for interaction with your personalized omniconfig builder.
 * You can get builder instance from {@link OmniconfigAPI#configBuilder(String, Version, SidedConfigType)}.<br>
 * Be aware that building every omniconfig file is done in three stages:<br><br>
 *
 * <b>1)</b> Initialization;<br>
 * <b>2)</b> Loading properties;<br>
 * <b>3)</b> Finalization.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * These phases are represented by respective {@link BuildingPhase} enum constants.
 * In order for building to be performed correctly, you <b>must</b> go over these phases in specific
 * order described above, only calling any of the builder methods on particular phase they belong to.
 * <br><br>
 * <p>
 * For that sake, methods of this interface are decorated with {@link PhaseOnly} annotation, specifying
 * during which phases this method can be called.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * If a method is decorated with {@link Finalizes}, it means that calling it explicitly ends building
 * phase specified as annotation value. While <code>INITIALIZATION</code> phase must be ended by
 * calling {@link #loadFile()} method, <code>PROPERTY_LOADING</code> phase doesn't have such method;
 * it can be ended either by calling any of the methods from <code>FINALIZATION</code> phase, all
 * of which are currently optional, or by right away calling {@link #build()} method, which can end
 * both <code>INITIALIZATION</code> and <code>FINALIZATION</code> phases.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * After <code>FINALIZATION</code> phase is over, builder is automatically invalidated;
 * calling any of its methods in such case will result in {@link IllegalStateException} being thrown.
