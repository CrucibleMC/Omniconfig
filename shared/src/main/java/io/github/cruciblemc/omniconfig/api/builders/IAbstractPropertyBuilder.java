/**
 * Generic interface that all specialized sub-property builders inherit from.<br><br>
 * <p>
 * One thing that this interface does not reflect, but which is common for all
 * sub-property builders is a possibility to assign validator function to future property,
 * so it will be described below:<br><br>
 * <p>
 * Validator function accepts bare property value immediately after it is parsed
 * from physical config file, and may perform checks to ensure that value satisfies
 * some arbitrary conditions. If it does, function should return same value it
 * received; otherwise it is free to return any sort of "closest valid" or "default"
 * value which will be assigned to property instance instead, and saved back to file if
 * this is the first time file is loaded from disc.<br>
 * This allows to assign complex validitation conditions to config properties, for
 * instance - to restrict a value property can take based on which value another property
 * has, and serves as an alternative to raising application-crashing exception with
 * error message informing the user why their configuration is invalid. However, you
 * should be aware that always using validators for that is not practical; if you
 * have complex properties, like sizeless string arrays that may contain non-trivial
 * user-created data and demand complex syntax, dropping their value every time something
 * is wrong with that syntax will probably not make your users happy. Realize nuances and
 * use this feature with care.
 *
 * @param <E> Property type this builder will create.
 * @param <T> Builder interface type itself.

     * instance itself, and instead want it's bare value to be assigned to
     * some simple field in your config handler class which you could then
     * refer to. As en example, consider the following snippet:
     *
     * <pre>
     * private static int specialValue = 10;
     *
     * // ...more class fields or something
     *

     *
     *     omniconfigBuilder.getInteger("specialInteger", specialValue)

     *     .build();
     *
     *     // ... subsequent config logic
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Such implementation will ensure that your <code>specialValue</code> will
     * be automatically assigned during initial config loading, as well as during
     * all subsequent re-loads if config was marked as reloadable via
     * {@link IOmniconfigBuilder#setReloadable()}. From here you should be able to
     * guess how that can be useful.

     * @param consumer Consumer to invoke
     * @return This sub-builder instance.
