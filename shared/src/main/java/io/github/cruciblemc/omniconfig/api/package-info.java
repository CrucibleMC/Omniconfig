 * General contract is as per usual - external implementers are free to

 * beyond it is considered internal workings of the project and must not be relied
 * upon by projects other than this, as such workings may undergo any amount of
 * refactoring and alteration in future updates. Only API package itself is attempted
 * to be kept as consistent as possible, avoiding any removals or breaking changes to it.
